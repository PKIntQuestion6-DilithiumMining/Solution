# Solution
This program uses C# and recursion to obtain the maximum yield.
It follows the established rules: no consecutive squares, the mininum spacing between two squares is 1.
Also, for optimum  results, the maximum distance is 2 - anything more would be sub-optimal.
This program has been unit-tested with various examples including the ones provided and works fine.
