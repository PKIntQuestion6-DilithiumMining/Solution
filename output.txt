Sample outputs using examples provided:

[ 206, 140, 300, 52, 107 ] should return 613 units, as mining the first, third, and fifth squares is optimal [ 206, x, 300, x, 107 ]
Optimum output = 613; Traverse Path = [0, 206]; [2, 300]; [4, 107];


[ 147, 206, 52, 240, 300 ] should return 506 units, as mining the second and fifth squares is optimal [ x, 206, x, x, 300 ]

Optimum output = 506; Traverse Path = [1, 206]; [4, 300];
